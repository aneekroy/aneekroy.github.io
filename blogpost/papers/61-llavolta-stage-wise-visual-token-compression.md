**Authors:** Various  
**Venue:** arXiv 2024  

## Abstract

Stage-wise training with heavy compression in early epochs/layers, gradually relaxed. Balances efficiency and performance through curriculum learning.

## Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 83.0%
- **FLOPs:** 1.1G
- **Parameters:** 7.0B

## Tags

`Stage-wise`, `Curriculum`

## Methodology

Stage-wise training with heavy compression in early epochs/layers, gradually relaxed. Balances efficiency and performance through curriculum learning.

## Future Directions

• Scaling the approach to larger model sizes and more diverse datasets.
• Investigating cross-task transfer learning capabilities.
• Exploring combinations with other efficiency techniques.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
