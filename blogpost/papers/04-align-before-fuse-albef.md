## Methodology

Unified separate encoders and cross-modal encoder without object detectors. Uses momentum distillation for strong performance.

Transfers knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters.

## Future Directions

• Scaling the approach to larger model sizes and more diverse datasets.
• Investigating cross-task transfer learning capabilities.
• Exploring combinations with other efficiency techniques.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
