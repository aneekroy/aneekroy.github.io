## Methodology

Image-tiling strategy with Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) for adaptive encoding. Dual Consistency Learning aligns multi-scale ViT encoders.

Adapts computation at runtime based on input complexity, allocating more resources to difficult samples and less to simpler ones.

## Future Directions

• Extending dynamic computation to multi-modal reasoning chains.
• Developing more efficient policy networks for token selection.
• Hardware-aware architecture search for specific edge devices.
• Exploring neural architecture search for optimal CNN-Transformer combinations.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
