## Methodology

Proposed shared & low-rank Transformers to reduce parameters by ~97% for audio-visual modeling. Uses a novel sharing mechanism across modalities.

## Future Directions

• Scaling the approach to larger model sizes and more diverse datasets.
• Investigating cross-task transfer learning capabilities.
• Exploring combinations with other efficiency techniques.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
