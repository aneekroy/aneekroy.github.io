**Authors:** Various  
**Venue:** ICCV 2025  
**Paper ID:** 57

## Abstract

Organizes visual tokens in tree structure for efficient pruning. Prunes entire branches of less important tokens while preserving key visual information.

## Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 83.5%
- **FLOPs:** 1.0G
- **Parameters:** 7.0B

## Tags

`Tree Structure`, `Branch Pruning`

## Methodology

Organizes visual tokens in tree structure for efficient pruning. Prunes entire branches of less important tokens while preserving key visual information.

## Future Directions

• Scaling the approach to larger model sizes and more diverse datasets.
• Investigating cross-task transfer learning capabilities.
• Exploring combinations with other efficiency techniques.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
