# QG-VTC: Query-Guided Visual Token Compression

**Authors:** Various  
**Venue:** arXiv 2024  
**Paper ID:** 59

## Abstract

Computes token relevance by embedding user's question and correlating with vision tokens. Task-aware compression keeps only query-relevant visual information.

## Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 83.5%
- **FLOPs:** 1.0G
- **Parameters:** 7.0B

## Tags

`Query-Guided`, `Task-Aware`

## Methodology

Computes token relevance by embedding user's question and correlating with vision tokens. Task-aware compression keeps only query-relevant visual information.

## Future Directions

• Scaling the approach to larger model sizes and more diverse datasets.
• Investigating cross-task transfer learning capabilities.
• Exploring combinations with other efficiency techniques.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
