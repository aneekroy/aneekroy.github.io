## Abstract

Hierarchical token pruning with pyramid structure. Fewer tokens in early layers, more aggressive pruning later. Outperforms FastV on localization tasks.

## Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 84.5%
- **FLOPs:** 1.4G

## Methodology

Hierarchical token pruning with pyramid structure. Fewer tokens in early layers, more aggressive pruning later. Outperforms FastV on localization tasks.

## Future Directions

• Scaling the approach to larger model sizes and more diverse datasets.
• Investigating cross-task transfer learning capabilities.
• Exploring combinations with other efficiency techniques.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
