## Methodology

Adaptive approach generating data-dependent forward paths. Gating function makes on-the-fly modality decisions. Reduces computation by 46.5% for sentiment analysis.

Adapts computation at runtime based on input complexity, allocating more resources to difficult samples and less to simpler ones.

## Future Directions

• Extending dynamic computation to multi-modal reasoning chains.
• Developing more efficient policy networks for token selection.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
