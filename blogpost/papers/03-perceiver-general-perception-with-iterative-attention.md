## Abstract

A modality-agnostic architecture using a small set of latent units to attend to large inputs. Decouples compute cost from input size.

## Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 76.4%
- **FLOPs:** 2.1G
- **Parameters:** 42M

## Methodology

A modality-agnostic architecture using a small set of latent units to attend to large inputs. Decouples compute cost from input size.

## Future Directions

• Scaling the approach to larger model sizes and more diverse datasets.
• Investigating cross-task transfer learning capabilities.
• Exploring combinations with other efficiency techniques.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
