## Methodology

Training-free token merging using bipartite soft matching. Reduces tokens by 2x with minimal accuracy drop. Works with any ViT without modification.

Combines similar tokens using bipartite matching or clustering algorithms, preserving semantic information while reducing the total number of tokens processed.

## Future Directions

• Exploring adaptive token budgets that vary based on task difficulty and input complexity.
• Investigating the combination of pruning and merging strategies for maximum efficiency.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
