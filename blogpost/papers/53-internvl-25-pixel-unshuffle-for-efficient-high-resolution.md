## Methodology

Pixel unshuffle reduces visual tokens from 1024 to 256 per 448x448 tile. Improves scalability for high-resolution image processing.

## Future Directions

• Scaling the approach to larger model sizes and more diverse datasets.
• Investigating cross-task transfer learning capabilities.
• Exploring combinations with other efficiency techniques.
• Benchmarking on emerging multimodal tasks and real-world applications.
